A basic experiment of building a rest api in Haskell, which was since expanded to include basic HTML forms support as well.

It uses SQLite.Simple for persistence and Text.Blaze for templating.

There are some really basic DocTests that are kicked off from make.

There's a makefile, that uses stack and cabal under the hood to build.


Other interesting things to remember:

To build during development:

stack build --fast --file-watch --exec "killall rest-test"
(in another terminal)
while :; do stack exec rest-test; done


TODO:
I concurrent access to endpoints are likely to result in SQLITE_BUSY errors
being returned - I should fix this, likely by putting a database handle in
an MVar in the ReaderT, to ensure only one guy is accessing the db at a time
